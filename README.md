# brief_case
Symfony app using MongoDB for incident reporting and document management

This project was primarily created as a vehicle to learn MongoDB and the Doctrine MongoDB ODM. The app is an incident managagement and reporting
tool. Users can create incident documents (cases), list people involved in the incident, provide background details, images and video, and other
useful information. Cases can be related to one another so that you can easily navigate between related cases.

Some basic reporting ideas are sketched out on the reporting page using the Chart.js framework. Like most of the this project, reports were included
due a desire to expirment with some technology that I hadn't used at the time, in this case Chart.js.

While BriefCase is mostly a mockup done as proof of concept, it would serve as a reasonable starting point for building a more robust a full featured case
management tool.
